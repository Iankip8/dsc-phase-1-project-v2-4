    "This project will entail using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to try and come up with useful insights that will be used by Microsoft to make informed bussiness decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Microsoft aims to gain a foothold in the film industry by launching its own film studio. However, lacking experience in film production, Microsoft sought to understand successful films to inform its strategy. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to identify key factors contributing to box office success, such as genre preferences, demographics and key responses. The insights gained will enable Microsoft to make informed decisions about the types of films to be released based on market trends and audience preferences. Ultimately, this move is intended to make Microsoft Movie Studios more competitive in the changing entertainment market.\n",
