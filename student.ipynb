    "This project will entail using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to try and come up with useful insights that will be used by Microsoft to make informed bussiness decisions.\n",
    "This is in regard to entering into a new market of origanal video production.\n",

    "## 1.2 Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft aims to gain a foothold in the film industry by launching its own film studio. However, lacking experience in film production, Microsoft sought to understand successful films to inform its strategy. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to identify key factors contributing to box office success, such as genre preferences, demographics and key responses. The insights gained will enable Microsoft to make informed decisions about the types of films to be released based on market trends and audience preferences. Ultimately, this move is intended to make Microsoft Movie Studios more competitive in the changing entertainment market.\n",

    "### Insight\n",
    "With a correlation coefficient of 0.86234, there is a high degree of linear dependency between total pay and the number of films produced by the studios. This insight implies that changes in one variable will likely result in predictable changes in the other variable. This implies that with increased production there will be an increase in the total revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's essential to note that correlation does not imply causation. While a correlation coefficient of 0.86234 indicates a strong association between the variables, it does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the other to change. There may be other underlying factors or variables influencing the observed relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while a positive correlation of 0.86234 provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables, further analysis and experimentation may be required to establish causality and make informed decisions."
